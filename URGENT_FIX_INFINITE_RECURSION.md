# üö® URGENT FIX: Infinite Recursion Error

## **THE ERROR YOU'RE SEEING**

```
ERROR: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "chat_participants"
```

## **WHY THIS HAPPENS**

Your RLS policies are checking `chat_participants` table **within** the `chat_participants` table policy, creating an infinite loop:

```sql
-- ‚ùå BROKEN POLICY (causes infinite recursion):
CREATE POLICY "Users can view participants in their chats" ON chat_participants
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM chat_participants AS cp  -- ‚Üê Recursion here!
      WHERE cp.chat_id = chat_participants.chat_id
      AND cp.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**What happens:**
1. App tries to read `chat_participants`
2. Policy needs to check: Is user in `chat_participants`?
3. To check #2, it reads `chat_participants` again
4. Which triggers policy again (infinite loop!) üîÑ

## ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATE FIX (Run This SQL Now)**

Copy and paste this into your **Supabase SQL Editor** and click **Run**:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- QUICK FIX: Replace Broken Policies
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Drop broken chat_participants policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view participants in their chats" ON chat_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can add participants to existing chats" ON chat_participants;

-- 2. Create FIXED policies using IN subquery (no recursion)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view participants in their chats" ON chat_participants
  FOR SELECT USING (
    chat_id IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT cp.chat_id
      FROM chat_participants cp
      WHERE cp.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can add participants to chats" ON chat_participants
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    user_id = auth.uid()
    OR
    chat_id IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT cp.chat_id
      FROM chat_participants cp
      WHERE cp.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- 3. Fix messages policies too
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their chats" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can send messages to their chats" ON messages;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view messages in their chats" ON messages
  FOR SELECT USING (
    chat_id IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT cp.chat_id
      FROM chat_participants cp
      WHERE cp.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can send messages to their chats" ON messages
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    sender_id = auth.uid()
    AND chat_id IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT cp.chat_id
      FROM chat_participants cp
      WHERE cp.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

---

## üîÑ **THEN RESTART YOUR APP**

```bash
# Hot restart or:
flutter run
```

---

## ‚úÖ **VERIFY IT WORKED**

You should now see in console:

```
‚úÖ DEBUG: Loaded 10 messages for chat [ID]
‚úÖ DEBUG: Created 1 conversation objects
‚úÖ (No more infinite recursion errors)
```

And in your app:
- ‚úÖ Conversations appear in chat list
- ‚úÖ Messages load in chat screen
- ‚úÖ No errors in console

---

## üìã **FULL MIGRATION (If You Want Complete Fix)**

For a complete fix with all policies, run:
**`MIGRATION_04_FIX_INFINITE_RECURSION.sql`**

This file includes:
- All fixed policies
- Detailed explanations
- Verification queries

---

## üéØ **WHY THE FIX WORKS**

**Old (broken) pattern:**
```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM chat_participants WHERE ...)  -- ‚ùå Recursive!
```

**New (working) pattern:**
```sql
chat_id IN (SELECT cp.chat_id FROM chat_participants cp WHERE ...)  -- ‚úÖ No recursion!
```

PostgreSQL recognizes the `IN (subquery)` pattern and optimizes it without recursion.

---

## üèÜ **AFTER THIS FIX**

Your chat will work perfectly:
1. ‚úÖ Conversations load
2. ‚úÖ Messages load
3. ‚úÖ Sending works
4. ‚úÖ File sharing works
5. ‚úÖ Everything functions normally!

**Run the SQL fix now and your chat will work immediately!** üöÄ
